                  Introduction: A research paper's objective is to gather multiple perspectives, supporting data, and verifiable facts about a subject from books, journals, and interviews, then to interpret the material in writing. It involves the interaction between the writer, readers, and other authors. Scholars and researchers primarily publish their discoveries and advancements in their fields of study through research papers.
                  While a research paper must be finalized in a format that is clear, concise, and well-organized, writing one is rather a difficult task. It includes processes like investigation, logical thinking, evaluating sources, organizing, and writing. These phases do not go in a straight line; instead, the author swings back and forth, and throughout the process, the argument and focus of the paper are developed.

                  Introduction: A poster presentation is a brief visual summary of research findings or a subject that is generally presented at conferences, seminars, or academic events on a sizable poster board. A strong visual presentation and high-quality studies are both components of an effective poster presentation. 
                  A STEM presentation uses text, graphs, charts, and graphics to explain difficult scientific concepts, experimental findings, or ground-breaking technology innovations. STEM poster presentations give researchers, engineers, and scientists opportunities to display their work, discuss ideas, and get peer comments. This promotes collaboration and the sharing of knowledge throughout the STEM community.

               <p class="fw1 f5 mt0 mb3">
                As part of an academic assignment, critical reflection involves carefully evaluating, analyzing, and assessing one's perspectives, learning experiences, and the content covered in a project or course. 
                It encourages learners to engage in in-depth reflection, challenge presumptions, and think broadly about the implications of their studies. Students can improve their critical thinking abilities and have a deeper knowledge of the subject matter by engaging in critical reflection. This approach frequently results in insightful understandings and personal development, making it a crucial part of a well-rounded education.

               <p class="fw1 f5 mt0 mb3">
                A literature review is carefully reviewing and summarizing previous scholarly works on a given subject or research question. It offers a thorough overview of the level of knowledge at the time on a certain topic. Writers use a literature review to critically study and analyze a variety of sources, including books, journals, and other academic publications, in order to spot trends, gaps, and points of contention. 
                Through this approach, they not only gain a deeper comprehension of the subject, but they are also better able to place their own research within the larger body of previous scholarship. An effective literature review is a crucial part of any academic paper since it provides a foundation for future research.

               <p class="fw1 f5 mt0 mb3">
                A policy brief is a concise document addressing a specific issue, offering a synthesis of research on the context, causes, stakeholders, and consequences of a situation or problem. Its primary purpose is to aid decision-makers and policymakers by presenting policy alternatives and suggestions. Policy briefs can have varied objectives; some advocate for a single policy option, while others propose multiple alternatives for consideration. It's important to ensure your approach aligns with the requirements of your assignment.
                Regarding length and style:
                A typical policy brief spans 4-6 pages and adopts a professional tone rather than an academic one, focusing on clear, jargon-free explanations.
                As for the target audience:
                Policy briefs are typically intended for readers in fields such as education, environment, politics, public health, or social work who are policymakers with a vested interest in the issue but may not possess an in-depth understanding of the subject matter. They seek the writer's insights and evidence-based recommendations.

                <p>Consider factors that can affect your choice of size and design, such as the timing, target audience, and venue of the presentation. Pick a design platform that works for you and the other team members(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiO4QPCk7SE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Canva</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=797-M5De_lA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adobe Illustrators</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WnhoIbfcoM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Power point</a>, etc). </p? \
                <p>Make a layout plan for your poster. Remember that the mix of text and graphics is visually appealing. Organize the material in a logical flow, usually from left to right and top to bottom. For simple reading, use headings and bullet points. Include illustrations to support your main ideas, such as charts, diagrams, and pictures. Use a consistent font style and size and leave some white space for a tidy, uncomplicated appearance. Last but not least, don\'t forget to give your contact details for future discussion and referrals.</p> \

                <p><strong>B. Create the poster</strong></p> \
                <ul> \
                <li>Tips on visual design: Use a clear, dark, legible font on a light background to make text easier to read. Use two to three complementing colors to increase visual impact. Keep the space on your poster clear. Consider eliminating a component if it does not enhance the clarity of your research. Data visualizations such as tables, charts, and other images are a common way to turn complex data sets into clear and accessible information. Copyright restrictions may apply if you use any text, image, or table that you did not make yourself.</li> \
                <li>Tips for text: Aim for short and to-the-point sentences. Bolding can be used to emphasize a few key details but be careful not to overuse it.</li> \
